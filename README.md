# Awesome Multimodal Models Experiments

In this repository, we share awesome examples, trials and errors related to multimodal generative AI models This includes models like Llava, GPT-4 Vision, Obisidian, etc.

Each experiment will have it's own folder with a minimal structure based on the Data Science Cookiecutter template. This means you'll find the following folders:

- README.md: general description of the experiment
- data: includes subfolders for input data (raw or external), interim and processed data
- docs: extended docs
- notebooks: notebooks for the different paths taken for the experiment 
- src: scripts or consolidated code from the notebooks goes in here

## Experiments

### Notes2JSON

This experiment aims to use vision models to extract the handwritten text and other features from color notes (like post-its) to structured text in JSON format.
